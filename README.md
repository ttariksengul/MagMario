This documentation provides an overview of the 2D platform game created using 
Unity. The game is designed to be similar to classic platform games like Mario, featuring 
running, jumping, collecting coins, avoiding or defeating enemies, and transitioning 
through multiple levels. The game includes various character animations and level
specific assets to enhance the gameplay experience.

Game Mechanics

Character Mechanics

  1. Run: The main character can run left and right using the arrow keys or "A" and 
  "D" keys. 
  2. Jump: The character can jump using the space bar. Jump height and animation 
  are implemented to provide a smooth experience. 
  3. Collect Coins: Coins are scattered throughout the levels. The player can collect 
  these coins to increase their score and earn extra lives. 
  4. Teleport: You can access the underground passage from the fourth tube by 
  pressing the "s" key. When exiting, approach the tube and press the "d" key.

Level Design

  1. Three Levels: The game features three levels, each increasing in difficulty with 
  unique assets and backgrounds. 
  2. Level Transition: The player transitions between levels by reaching the end of 
  each level and interacting with a flagpole. The game progresses to the next level 
  upon completion of the current one. 
  3. Unique Assets: Each level has distinct assets and backgrounds to provide variety 
  and enhance the visual appeal.

Challenges and Bonuses

  1. Enemies: Enemies are placed throughout the levels. The player must avoid or 
  defeat them to progress. 
  2. Bonus Items: Bonus items, such as temporary power-ups or extra points, are 
  available to provide advantages to the player. 
  3. Increasing Difficulty: Each level is progressively more challenging with more 
  enemies, fewer platforms, or other obstacles.
